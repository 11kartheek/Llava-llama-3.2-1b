## LLaVA 1.5: Training on 150k Dataset

### Overview
This repository explores the **LLaVA 1.5** model, a state-of-the-art architecture designed for various natural language processing tasks. This project involves training LLaVA 1.5 on a dataset of subet of **150,000 samples** to evaluate its performance and capabilities.

### How LLaVA 1.5 Works
The LLaVA 1.5 model integrates a **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)** projection layer with the LLaVA architecture, along with **QLoRA** (Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation) for efficient training and fine-tuning. 

- **Architecture**: 
  - The MLP projection maps image embeddings into the text embedding space, allowing the model to handle multi-modal inputs effectively.
  - The integration of QLoRA enables low-rank updates to the model's parameters, significantly reducing memory consumption and improving training speed while retaining performance.

## Future Work and what i could have done better
- add chat memory for now it is just multi turn q&a
- use random concatenation as suggeseted in paper
- train on complete dataset
