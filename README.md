## LLaVA 1.5: Training on 150k Dataset

### Overview
This repository explores the **LLaVA 1.5** model, a state-of-the-art architecture designed for various natural language processing tasks. This project involves training LLaVA 1.5 on a dataset subset of **150,000 samples** to evaluate its performance and capabilities. LLaVA 1.5 transforms a traditional language model into a multimodal model capable of processing both text and image inputs. we are also adding a whisper projection to add audio capability

### How LLaVA 1.5 Works
LLaVA 1.5 transforms a traditional language model into a multimodal model capable of processing both text and image inputs. This is achieved by integrating Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) projection and QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation) into the LLaVA architecture, making it versatile and memory-efficient.

- **Architecture**: 
  - The MLP projection maps image embeddings into the text embedding space, allowing the model to handle multi-modal inputs effectively.
  - The integration of QLoRA enables low-rank updates to the model's parameters, significantly reducing memory consumption and improving training speed while retaining performance.

### Hugging Face Space
Explore the model in action and its capabilities on Hugging Face Spaces: [LLaVA 1.5 Space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Kartheekb7/llava_chat).

## Future Work 
- add chat memory (for now it is just multiturn Q&A)
- use random concatenation as suggeseted in paper
